            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The LogFC (Log Fold Change) method was developed for Crunch 3 of the Broad Institute IBD Challenge, focusing on 
                ranking genes based on their ability to differentiate between dysplastic and non-dysplastic tissue regions. 
                This page provides a detailed explanation of the LogFC method and its application in identifying gene markers 
                for inflammatory bowel disease.

        <section>
            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <p>The LogFC method is based on several key concepts in differential gene expression analysis:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Log Fold Change</h3>
            <p>
                Log fold change (logFC) is a measure of how much a gene's expression changes between two conditions. 
                It is calculated as the logarithm (usually base 2) of the ratio of expression values:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
logFC = log2(expression_in_dysplastic / expression_in_non_dysplastic)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                A positive logFC indicates higher expression in dysplastic regions, while a negative logFC indicates 
                higher expression in non-dysplastic regions. The magnitude of the logFC indicates the strength of the 
                differential expression.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Statistical Significance</h3>
            <p>
                While logFC measures the magnitude of differential expression, it's also important to assess whether 
                this difference is statistically significant. This is typically done using statistical tests such as 
                t-tests or their variants, which calculate a p-value for each gene.
            </p>
            <p>
                The p-value represents the probability of observing the measured difference (or a more extreme one) 
                by chance if there were no actual difference between the conditions. A lower p-value indicates stronger 
                evidence for differential expression.
            </p>
            
            <h3>3. Multiple Testing Correction</h3>
            <p>
                When testing thousands of genes simultaneously, there's a high risk of false positives due to multiple 
                testing. To address this, various correction methods are applied, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure 
                to control the false discovery rate (FDR).
            </p>
            <p>
                After correction, we obtain adjusted p-values (q-values) that represent the expected proportion of false 
                positives among the genes called significant at that threshold.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Volcano Plots</h3>
            <p>
                Volcano plots are a common visualization technique for differential expression results. They plot the 
                negative logarithm of the p-value against the logFC, allowing for easy identification of genes that are 
                both highly differentially expressed and statistically significant.

            <h3>1. Group Definition</h3>
            <p>
                The first step in the LogFC method is to define the groups for comparison. In the context of the 
                IBD Challenge, these groups are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dysplastic</strong>: Cells from regions showing pre-cancerous changes</li>
                <li><strong>Non-dysplastic</strong>: Cells from normal or inflamed (but not dysplastic) regions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Group assignment can be based on pathologist annotations, image analysis, or a combination of both.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Define groups based on cell labels
dysplastic_mask = cell_labels == 'dysplastic'
non_dysplastic_mask = cell_labels == 'non_dysplastic'

# Get expression data for each group
dysplastic_expr = gene_expression[dysplastic_mask]
non_dysplastic_expr = gene_expression[non_dysplastic_mask]
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>2. Expression Aggregation</h3>
            <p>
                Once the groups are defined, gene expression values are aggregated within each group. This typically 
                involves calculating the mean or median expression for each gene in each group.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Aggregate expression within each group
dysplastic_mean = np.mean(dysplastic_expr, axis=0)
non_dysplastic_mean = np.mean(non_dysplastic_expr, axis=0)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>3. Log Fold Change Calculation</h3>
            <p>
                The log fold change is calculated for each gene by taking the logarithm (base 2) of the ratio of 
                mean expression values between the two groups.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Calculate log fold change
# Add small constant to avoid division by zero
epsilon = 1e-10
log_fold_change = np.log2((dysplastic_mean + epsilon) / (non_dysplastic_mean + epsilon))
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>4. Statistical Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Statistical tests are performed to assess the significance of the observed differences. Common tests 
                include t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, or more sophisticated methods like those implemented in 
                DESeq2 or edgeR.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Perform t-tests for each gene
p_values = []
for i in range(gene_expression.shape[1]):
    t_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(
        dysplastic_expr[:, i],
        non_dysplastic_expr[:, i],
        equal_var=False  # Welch's t-test
    )
    p_values.append(p_val)
p_values = np.array(p_values)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>5. Multiple Testing Correction</h3>
            <p>
                To account for multiple testing, p-values are adjusted using methods like Benjamini-Hochberg to 
                control the false discovery rate.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Apply Benjamini-Hochberg correction
from statsmodels.stats.multitest import multipletests
_, q_values, _, _ = multipletests(p_values, method='fdr_bh')
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>6. Gene Ranking</h3>
            <p>
                Genes are ranked based on a combination of their logFC magnitude and statistical significance. 
                Common approaches include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ranking by absolute logFC among statistically significant genes</li>
                <li>Ranking by statistical significance among genes with logFC above a threshold</li>
                <li>Ranking by a combined score that considers both logFC and significance</li>
            </ul>
            <pre><code>
# Create results dataframe
import pandas as pd
results = pd.DataFrame({
    'gene': gene_names,
    'log_fold_change': log_fold_change,
    'p_value': p_values,
    'q_value': q_values
})

# Filter for significant genes
significant_genes = results[results['q_value'] < 0.05]

# Rank by absolute log fold change
ranked_genes = significant_genes.sort_values(by='log_fold_change', key=abs, ascending=False)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>7. Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                The results are visualized using techniques like volcano plots, heatmaps, or bar plots to facilitate 
                interpretation and communication.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Create volcano plot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.scatter(
    results['log_fold_change'],
    -np.log10(results['p_value']),
    alpha=0.5
)
plt.axhline(-np.log10(0.05), color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.axvline(-1, color='blue', linestyle='--')

            <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
            <p>
                Our implementation of the LogFC method includes several advanced techniques to improve the accuracy 
                and interpretability of the results:
            </p>
            
            <h3>1. Robust Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of using simple means and t-tests, we employ robust statistics that are less sensitive to 
                outliers and non-normal distributions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Median</strong> instead of mean for expression aggregation</li>
                <li><strong>Wilcoxon rank-sum test</strong> instead of t-test for statistical testing</li>
                <li><strong>Robust estimation of variance</strong> using methods like median absolute deviation (MAD)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Spatial Context Integration</h3>
            <p>
                We integrate spatial context into the LogFC analysis to account for tissue heterogeneity and spatial 
                patterns of gene expression:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial weighting</strong> of cells based on their proximity to region boundaries</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial clustering</strong> to identify coherent regions with similar expression patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial smoothing</strong> of expression values to reduce noise</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Pathway Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                We extend the gene-level analysis to pathway-level insights using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
                and related techniques:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gene set enrichment analysis</strong> to identify pathways enriched in dysplastic regions</li>
                <li><strong>Pathway activity scoring</strong> to quantify pathway activation in individual cells</li>
                <li><strong>Network analysis</strong> to identify key regulatory genes and their targets</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Machine Learning Integration</h3>
            <p>
                We integrate machine learning techniques to improve gene ranking and identify complex patterns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feature importance</strong> from random forests or gradient boosting models</li>
                <li><strong>Regularized regression</strong> (e.g., LASSO) for feature selection</li>
                <li><strong>Deep learning</strong> for capturing complex, non-linear relationships</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Applications in IBD Research</h2>
            <p>
                The LogFC method has several important applications in inflammatory bowel disease research:
            </p>
            
            <h3>1. Biomarker Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                By identifying genes that are differentially expressed between dysplastic and non-dysplastic regions, 
                the LogFC method can help discover biomarkers for early detection of pre-cancerous changes in IBD patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                These biomarkers could be used for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-invasive screening tests (e.g., blood or stool tests)</li>
                <li>Targeted biopsies during colonoscopy</li>
                <li>Risk stratification of patients</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Disease Mechanism Understanding</h3>
            <p>
                The differentially expressed genes identified by the LogFC method can provide insights into the 
                molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from inflammation to dysplasia and cancer in IBD.
            </p>
            <p>
                This understanding can help:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify key pathways involved in dysplasia development</li>
                <li>Understand the role of inflammation in cancer progression</li>
                <li>Discover new therapeutic targets</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Therapeutic Target Identification</h3>
            <p>
                Genes with high logFC values may represent potential therapeutic targets for preventing or treating 
                dysplasia in IBD patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                These targets could be used for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drug development</li>
                <li>Repurposing existing drugs</li>
                <li>Personalized treatment approaches</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Patient Stratification</h3>
            <p>
                The gene expression patterns identified by the LogFC method can be used to stratify patients based on 
                their molecular profiles, potentially identifying those at higher risk of developing dysplasia or cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This stratification could inform:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Surveillance strategies</li>
                <li>Preventive interventions</li>
                <li>Treatment decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>More accurate gene expression predictions as input to the LogFC analysis</li>
                <li>Improved spatial context integration for more precise differential expression analysis</li>
                <li>Cell type-aware analysis that accounts for cellular heterogeneity</li>
                <li>A comprehensive solution that spans from raw data to biological insights</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                For more details on how we integrate these approaches, please see the <a href="unified_approach.html">Unified Approach</a> page.
