            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Tarandros approach was developed for Crunch 2 of the Broad Institute IBD Challenge, focusing on inferring 
                the expression of unmeasured genes based on measured gene predictions and reference datasets. This page provides 
                a detailed explanation of the Tarandros approach and its key innovations that led to superior cell-wise Spearman 
                correlation performance.

                <h3>Tarandros at a Glance</h3>
                <p>Key performance metrics from Crunch 2 evaluation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cell-wise Spearman correlation</strong>: 52.792 (compared to DeepSpot's 45.937)</li>
                    <li><strong>Gene-wise Spearman correlation</strong>: 14.8 (compared to DeepSpot's 16.168)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These metrics highlight Tarandros's strength in preserving cell-specific expression patterns, which is crucial for accurate cell type identification and functional analysis.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Innovations</h2>
            <p>The Tarandros approach introduced several key innovations that contributed to its superior cell-wise performance:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Cell-wise Optimization</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike DeepSpot, which primarily focused on gene-wise metrics, Tarandros explicitly optimizes for cell-wise 
                Spearman correlation. This means it prioritizes preserving the relative expression levels of different genes 
                within each cell, which better captures cellular state and function.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Similarity-based Gene Inference</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros uses a similarity-based approach to infer unmeasured gene expression. It calculates the similarity 
                between predicted measured gene expressions and reference data, then uses these similarities to transfer 
                unmeasured gene expressions from the reference to the target cells.
            </p>
            
            <h3>3. Cell Type Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros incorporates explicit cell type classification to improve prediction accuracy. By identifying 
                cell types, it can leverage cell type-specific expression patterns from reference datasets.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Reference Dataset Integration</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros effectively integrates single-cell RNA sequencing reference data to guide the prediction of 
                unmeasured genes. This reference data provides valuable information about gene co-expression patterns 
                and cell type-specific expression profiles.
            </p>
            
            <h3>5. Spatial Context Preservation</h3>
            <p>
                While leveraging reference data, Tarandros maintains spatial context by refining predictions based on 
                local spatial relationships. This ensures that the predicted gene expressions are consistent with the 
                spatial organization of the tissue.
            </p>

            <h3>Cell Type Classification</h3>
            <p>
                The first step in the Tarandros approach is to classify cells based on their measured gene expression profiles. 
                This is done using a neural network that takes measured gene expressions as input and outputs cell type probabilities.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Cell type classification
cell_type_logits = self.cell_type_classifier(measured_gene_expressions)
cell_type_probs = F.softmax(cell_type_logits, dim=-1)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Expression Similarity Calculation</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros calculates the similarity between predicted measured gene expressions and reference data. 
                This similarity is used to identify reference cells that are most similar to each target cell.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Calculate expression similarity
def _compute_expression_similarity(pred_expressions, ref_expressions):
    # Normalize expressions
    pred_norm = F.normalize(pred_expressions, p=2, dim=1)
    ref_norm = F.normalize(ref_expressions, p=2, dim=1)
    
    # Calculate cosine similarity
    similarity = torch.matmul(pred_norm, ref_norm.transpose(0, 1))
    return similarity
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Combined Weighting</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros combines cell type probabilities and expression similarities to create weights for transferring 
                unmeasured gene expressions from reference to target cells.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Combine cell type probabilities and expression similarities
combined_weights = cell_type_probs * measured_similarity
combined_weights = combined_weights / (combined_weights.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True) + 1e-8)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Weighted Reference Expression</h3>
            <p>
                Using the combined weights, Tarandros calculates a weighted average of reference unmeasured gene expressions 
                for each target cell.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Calculate weighted reference expression
reference_predictions = torch.matmul(combined_weights, self.reference_expressions)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Spatial Refinement</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, Tarandros refines the predictions using spatial context. It adjusts the predictions based on the 
                expressions of neighboring cells, ensuring spatial coherence.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
# Refine predictions using spatial context
spatial_weights = self._compute_spatial_weights(spatial_coordinates)
spatial_context = torch.matmul(spatial_weights, unmeasured_predictions)
refined_predictions = alpha * unmeasured_predictions + (1 - alpha) * spatial_context
            </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Cell-wise Spearman Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                A key innovation in Tarandros is its explicit optimization for cell-wise Spearman correlation. This is 
                achieved through a specialized loss function that directly optimizes for preserving the relative expression 
                levels of different genes within each cell.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Cell-wise Spearman Loss</h3>
            <p>
                The cell-wise Spearman loss function calculates the Spearman correlation coefficient for each cell and 
                then averages across cells. This encourages the model to preserve the relative expression levels of 
                different genes within each cell.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
def cell_wise_spearman_loss(predictions, targets, eps=1e-8):
    # Convert to ranks along gene dimension (dim=1)
    def _to_ranks(x):
        ranks = torch.argsort(torch.argsort(x, dim=1), dim=1).float()
        return ranks
    
    pred_ranks = _to_ranks(predictions)
    target_ranks = _to_ranks(targets)
    
    # Calculate mean rank for each cell
    pred_mean = pred_ranks.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    target_mean = target_ranks.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
    
    # Calculate differences from mean
    pred_diff = pred_ranks - pred_mean
    target_diff = target_ranks - target_mean
    
    # Calculate covariance
    cov = (pred_diff * target_diff).sum(dim=1)
    
    # Calculate standard deviations
    pred_std = torch.sqrt((pred_diff ** 2).sum(dim=1) + eps)
    target_std = torch.sqrt((target_diff ** 2).sum(dim=1) + eps)
    
    # Calculate correlation
    correlation = cov / (pred_std * target_std + eps)
    
    # Return loss (1 - mean correlation)
    return 1.0 - correlation.mean()
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Comparison with Gene-wise Optimization</h3>
            <p>
                In contrast to cell-wise optimization, gene-wise optimization (as used in DeepSpot) calculates the 
                Spearman correlation coefficient for each gene and then averages across genes. This encourages the 
                model to preserve the relative expression levels of each gene across different cells.
            </p>
            <p>
                The choice between cell-wise and gene-wise optimization depends on the specific application:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cell-wise optimization</strong> is better for cell type identification, cellular function analysis, and understanding cellular states</li>
                <li><strong>Gene-wise optimization</strong> is better for gene function analysis, pathway analysis, and understanding gene regulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Tarandros's superior performance on cell-wise metrics makes it particularly valuable for applications 
                that require accurate cell type identification and cellular function analysis.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Reference Dataset Integration</h2>
            <p>
                Another key innovation in Tarandros is its effective integration of reference datasets. This allows 
                the model to leverage prior knowledge about gene co-expression patterns and cell type-specific expression 
                profiles.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Reference Dataset Selection</h3>
            <p>
                The choice of reference dataset is crucial for the performance of Tarandros. Ideally, the reference 
                dataset should:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the same tissue type as the target dataset</li>
                <li>Include a diverse range of cell types</li>
                <li>Have high-quality gene expression measurements</li>
                <li>Include both measured and unmeasured genes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Reference Dataset Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Before using the reference dataset, it needs to be processed to ensure compatibility with the target 
                dataset. This includes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Normalizing expression values to a common scale</li>
                <li>Aligning gene identifiers between reference and target</li>
                <li>Filtering out low-quality cells and genes</li>
                <li>Annotating cell types if not already done</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Reference Integration in Tarandros</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros integrates the reference dataset in two main ways:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cell Type Classification</strong>: The reference dataset is used to train the cell type 
                    classifier, providing labeled examples of different cell types.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Expression Transfer</strong>: The reference dataset provides unmeasured gene expressions 
                    that are transferred to target cells based on similarity and cell type.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                This integration allows Tarandros to leverage prior knowledge while still adapting to the specific 
                characteristics of the target dataset.
            </p>

                <li><strong>Computational complexity</strong>: The similarity calculation and reference integration can be computationally intensive</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Ideal Use Cases</h3>
            <p>
                Tarandros is particularly well-suited for:
